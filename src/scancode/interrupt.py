    Call `func` function with `args` and `kwargs` arguments and return a tuple of
    (success, return value). `func` is invoked through a wrapper in a thread and
    will be interrupted if it does not return within `timeout` seconds of execution
    or uses more than 'max_memory` MEGABYTES of memory.

    `func` returned results must be pickable.
    `timeout` in seconds defaults to DEFAULT_TIMEOUT.

    `max_memory` is the memory quota in megabytes and defaults to DEFAULT_MAX_MEMORY.
    If zero, then no memory quota is enforced.

    `args` and `kwargs` are passed to `func` as *args and **kwargs.

    In the returned tuple of (success, value), success is True or False.
    If success is True, the call was successful and the second item in the tuple is
    the returned value of `func`.
    If success is False, the call did not complete within `timeout` seconds or
    exceeded `max_memory` memory usage and was interrupted. In this case, the second
    item in the tuple is an error message string.
